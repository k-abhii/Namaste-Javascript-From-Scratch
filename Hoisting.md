## Hoisting is phenomenon in Javascript by which you can access varibles and function Even Before you have initialize it or put some value to it without an error 

## Whenever we are running a javascript program An Execution Context Created and it created in 2 phase 
## 1st Phase Memory Creation Phase 
## 2nd phase  Code Execution Phase or Thread Execution 
## Even before Javascript code start executing Memory is allocated to each and every variables and function 

## Even before code get executed Javascript allocate memory to x and place a place holder undefined to it 

In getName() function we did not get undefined but actual copy of the fuunction --in 1st phase memory creation 

## In case arrow function and other type
